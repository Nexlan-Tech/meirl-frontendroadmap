# meirl-frontendroadmap

A real time documentation and skills/education resource of my journey to becoming a front end developer with no experience.

This journey began in about April of 2022. I was a 36 year old mom of four and tired of dead end jobs that didn't pay the bills 
but couldn't afford nor take the time to go to college. 

One day I came across the Google IT certificate at Coursera and realized I could learn things online, for free, within the technology field
And this could realistically become a well paid, well respected career. 

I started the course and the rest is history- you'll see it all here. I really believe the roadmap towards these skills and not only how to acquire them 
But when and how to use them needs to be streamlined and broken down for everyone to understand. I don't believe that's happening right now so I hope to bring
That into the "hello and real world."
